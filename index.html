        <p> Attributes are the data type used in the visualization above. Although variables aren't specified, all of the variables use numerical data, which fall under a
            attribute type (categorical, ordinal, or quantitative) In regards to the marks utilized, points and areas are used (items/ nodes). The points 
            are the locations of each chart on the axes, while the areas are the regions on each of the pie charts. In terms of the channels, this visualization 
            uses position, size and color. The coordinates of the pi charts are both horizontal and vertical position, the size is the change in area of each pie chart, and the color of each region in the pi chart are representative of different variables.

        <p> Attributes are the data type used in the visualization above. The variable on the x-axis is year, which is a categorical variable in this case, as it is used
            as a classification of the data points and not used for computational purposes. The variable on the y-axis is also categorical with the same reasoning, but with labels A through E. Points are the only mark used in this visualization (item/ node) and it is used to represent each coordinate in the visualization. Regarding channels, position and color are used with positioning representing what rank each point is in which given year and color representing different records in the dataset.

        <p> Items are the data type used in the visualization above with each data point being a node in the network. In this case, the mark is a connnection (link). The visual is used to visually organise information where nodes are then asssoicated with one another which ultimately connect to the central concept (THEME). As for channels, color is utilized to color code which node is the central concept, and also may have correlation with the other nodes, but it is not clear, as nodes with the same name are provided with a different color. <br> <br> <br>

        <p> Attributes are the data type uses in the visualziation above. The x-axis axis variable is categorical as it classifies variables in either A, B, C, or D. Looking at the y-axis variable, numerical values are provided, which appears to be quantitative. Each variable on the x-axis is then categorized into 4 subgroups by another categorical variable. Looking at the marks, lines are used (item/ node), as each bar on the graph is given a length correlated to the value on the y-axis. In regards to the channels, the position is used, as it is a coordinate, so both the x and y axis are involved. Also, color is used to classify the subgrouops within each bar.
